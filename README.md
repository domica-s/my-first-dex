# my-first-dex
This is a repository of me learning the basics of Web 3 via LearnWeb3DAO, and this is the eight part, where I created my first DEX, allowing the swap of ETH and an ERC-20 token I created in another project, along with the DEX's website, built using React and Next js

View the DAO's contract on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xdA4e86CC54eEB2b2ae924ca9D11E12A0F73aC74B
